# hello-world
Welcome to my first repository for the year 2022. 
## What I have learned over the years:
1. Procrastination is never satisfied. If you let it, you'll procrastinate until your deathbed.
2. Learning is neverending. The moment you stop learning, you stop living.
3. If you consider coding to be an art, then the most imporant thing to do is work, sit down every day and keep trying.

If any of these sounded familiar to you then it's probably because you crossed paths with Steve Pressfield's *The War of Art*.
Definitely not for the faint of heart or people easily offended by spiritual musings.[^1]

I'm not getting any younger, and it's no use whining about the coulda woulda shoulda. ==I either learn to code, or I don't.== 
So here I am, sitting down and trying. If I wait until everything is perfect, I will never get a thing done. But if I do 100 small steps, 100 small changes, 100 small improvements. At the end, at the sum of it all, I might actually arrive at something pretty close to perfect, or atleast better than what I could have ever hoped for.

So keep trying, keep pushing forward, keep going. Then when you're done, continue on to the next job.
